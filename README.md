# Super-Market-Billing-System

# Introduction

The SuperMarket Billing System in Java is a software application designed to streamline and automate billing and inventory management processes for a supermarket. This project aims to provide a robust solution for supermarkets to efficiently manage customer transactions, product inventory, and customer information. By utilizing Java with Swing for the user interface and SQLite as the database, the system offers two distinct profiles: Admin and Cashier.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Efficient Billing: To create a billing system that allows Cashiers to quickly and accurately process customer orders and generate bills.
Inventory Management: To maintain an organized record of products in the supermarket, allowing Admins to add, delete, and update product information.
User Roles: To differentiate between Admin and Cashier roles, granting specific privileges and functionality to each.
Database Integration: To use SQLite as the database system, providing a lightweight and efficient means of storing and managing data.
User-Friendly Interface: To develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface using Swing, ensuring ease of use for supermarket staff.
